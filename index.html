    For fully electric planes to be possible there must be new advances in battery technology to make them more energy dense, as well as 
    making the production of batteries more sustainable for the environment. Airports would also need significant upgrades to their electric 
    infrastructure to accommodate higher energy requirements. Electric planes would significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions due 
    to the removal of combustible fuels in their engines, as well as a reduction in noise pollution on take-off and landing in the areas around 
    airports.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <pre>
    With an increased focus on sustainable transport methods, aircraft will need to become less reliant on fossil fuel as their source of power.
    The most obvious solution is for electricity to be the main power source of aircraft in future designs. However, this is not an easy solution 
    as it will require major advances in battery technology and complete rebuilding of airport infrastructure to support any electric aircraft(2).
    </pre>

<h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>

   <pre>
    There are significant challenges in designing electric aircraft. Firstly, there is the issue of the batteries required to power the aircraft. 
    Lithium-ion batteries have significantly lower energy density than conventional jet fuel (2), (450 watt hours per kilogram compared to 12000 
    watt hours per kilogram, (3), and even with poor engine efficiency of 50% jet fuel still has 6000 watt hours per kilogram(1)) meaning that a 
    large number of batteries will be needed to make up for this, so electric aircraft will only be able to fly for short amounts of time. Because 
    of the large number of heavy batteries required, as much as 60% of the weight of the vehicle could be made up of batteries, compared to the much
    lower 30% of the weight being fuel in current plane designs (2). However, with 50% of all global flight being less than 500 miles it wouldn’t be
    problematic to begin with(2). For this reason, any plans for electric aircraft would be best suited to private planes at first, until the battery 
    technology required for commercial flights is possible. 
     
    As well as this, there needs to be suitable infrastructure to support electric planes, such as a way to recharge the batteries quickly, especially 
    if electric planes are to replace current commercial aircraft which can refuel in less than an hour and fly for up to twenty-one(2). 
     
    Once these challenges are overcome electric planes offer multiple benefits, such as significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions from the aircraft 
    themselves. Electric aircraft would eliminate direct air pollution(6) as they would not have any combustion of fossil fuels in their engines. However, 
    during the manufacturing process of creating lithium-ion batteries, vast amounts of CO2 is produced. For each kilowatt hour (kWh) of range in the 
    produced battery, 73kg of CO2 has been produced (see Figure 1).
     
    Figure 1: CO2 Produced from the Production of Lithium-Ion Batteries
    <img src="Figure1.png" alt="Banner" width="900" height="150">

    40% of the CO2 comes from mining the materials needed for the batteries (Nickel, Manganese, and Cobalt (NCM) and lithium are mined and then processed 
    into cathode powder) which accounts for 28.5 kg of CO2 /kWh of the 73kg. The next most polluting step of this process is making the battery cell itself, 
    then comes producing the aluminium for the casing of the cell (7). For a small 2-seat aircraft, a 21kWh battery is used, so in its production 1533kg of 
    CO2 has been produced, but aircraft of equal size to current private jets would need significantly more. One company, Heart Aerospace, is designing 
    a 19 seat electric plane which will have four 180kWh batteries, each one requiring 13140kg of Co2 to be produced, which would total at 52560kg for a 
    set of batteries to power just one aircraft(7)(8). One reason for the high CO2 emissions is that they are often made in countries which make their energy 
    with non-renewable sources (e.g. China, which produces 60% of its electricity from coal). This means that if the countries which made these batteries switched
    to cleaner energy sources, or if production is moved to countries that already have higher percentages of clean energy sources, the carbon footprint of 
    lithium-ion batteries would decrease(7).

    Noise pollution of aircraft on take-off is expected to be reduced due to higher mass flow and lower exhaust speed of electric motors compared to conventional
    turbofan engines(5). However, noise on approach could be louder due to expected designs being much heavier on landing than current aircraft, resulting in higher
    thrust requirements and therefore more noise from the engines(5). Even though there will be more noise when landing it will be minimal, with only a 15% larger
    noise contour area compared to current aircraft(6), and the noise contour area on take-off will be reduced by more than 50%(6).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    
<pre>
    In conclusion, electric aircraft are not possible on a commercial basis just yet, but there are possibilities in the private sector of air travel due to any current 
    designs having ideal ranges for quick trips across a country. However, the startup cost of electric aircraft will be high due to a large number of energy dense batteries
    needing to be produced, which is costly for the manufacturer and the environment, but with a shift to greener and cheaper energy sources this could be mitigated slightly. 
    Electric planes would also be beneficial to those that live around airports, especially private airfields which see large numbers of private aircraft arrive and depart 
    from, as they will produce less noise over a smaller area overall.
